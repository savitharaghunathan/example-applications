# Customer-tomcat-legacy application

## Goals
In this example, you will learn the insights on what changes are required to containerize a Java application running on tomcat server. This example uses Konveyor operator to perform analysis on the application source code, the results of which produces insights needed to containerize the app.

## Prerequisites 
* Minikube
* Podman
* Konveyor Operator

## Konveyor Operator Installation 
To install Konveyor operator in your minikube cluster, follow along these set of [instructions](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-operator#tackle-operator-installation-on-k8s)

_NOTE If you are using macOS, please follow along [this guide](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-operator/blob/main/docs/installation-macos.md) for Konveyor operator installation._
_To install `Konveyor` latest, please use the manifest from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konveyor/tackle2-operator/main/tackle-k8s.yaml`._

## Get started with Analysis

1. Create an app entry called `customer-tomcat` in the `Analysis` tab of the tackle ui. 
    * Fill in the name of the application
    * Expand source code and enter the following
        * Repository Type: Git
        * Source Repository: https://github.com/konveyor/example-applications.git
        * Branch: main
        * Root path: /example-1/

    * Click on the `Create`  button.

2. Select the `customer-tomcat` app and click on the `Analyze` button.

    * An application analysis wizard will open. 
        * Select `Source Code + dependencies` in the dropdown and click `Next` button

        * In the `Set Targets` pane, select `Containerization` option and click `Next`

        * For scope, select `Application and internal dependencies only` 
        ![](img/step2a3.png)

        * Keep the defaults in Advanced section
        * Move to the `Review` pane, and click on `Run` button
        ![](img/step2a4.png)


3. You will notice that the status of the app has been updated to `In Progess`. Wait until it changes to `Completed`.

4. Click on the app, and a pop-up pane will appear on the right side of the window with three tabs.

In the `Tags` tab, you can see the tags organized by categories that are applicable to this application.

Click on the `Reports` tab, and select the `Report` hyperlink.

5. Konveyor Analysis dashboard gets opened in a new tab.
![](img/step5.png)
Since we selected `Source code + Dependencies` in the Analysis wizard, in addition to the example-1 app report, we also have a report for the dependencies. 

6. Click on the `All Issues` tab in the top navigation bar.
![](img/step6a.png)
Here you can see a list of informational issues and a couple of issues in the cloud mandatory column along with story point estimates. 
![](img/step6b.png)
Click on the issues to expand them. This view provides detailed information regarding File system - Java IO and Hard-coded IP address respectively.
![](img/step6c.png)

7. Letâ€™s look into each of the issues
   * File system - Java IO: This issue flags that the app is reading from a file location.This creates awareness, so that the migrator/architect is aware of data access and its dependencies. Click on the hyperlink highlighted below,
![](img/step7a.png)
It will navigate to a page which provides finer details on the location of the identified issue itself.
![](img/step7b.png)
   * Hard-coded IP address: To run an app in Kubernetes, it needs to be portable and highly configurable. The application should not have hardcoded values and provide mechanisms to pass the required arguments through a config object or via environmental variables. In this example, we have identified that the app uses a 
hardcoded IP address and it needs to be changed to make it cloud ready. 
![](img/step7c.png)
If you click on the file, it will show you the exact location of the line with the hard coded static IP address.
![](img/step7d.png)
Using the above information, the migrator/architect can estimate the amount of effort needed to modernize the application and also have an idea of what changes are needed to be cloud ready. 

We have successfuly ran `Analysis` on the Java legacy application and found issues that need to be fixed to make this app cloud ready.
